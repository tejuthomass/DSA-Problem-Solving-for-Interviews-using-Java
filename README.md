# DSA Problem Solving for Interviews using Java

This repository contains my solutions to the problems and exercises from the "DSA Problem Solving for Interviews using Java" course offered by Scaler Topics.

## About the Course

- **Course Name**: DSA Problem Solving for Interviews using Java
- **Platform**: Scaler Topics
- **Instructor**: Jitender Punia, Software Engineer and Instructor at Scaler

This free online course is designed to help prepare for data structure and algorithm (DSA) interview questions using Java. It is suitable for beginners who want to learn DSA problem solving and its applications in job interviews.

## Course Structure

1. **M1: Arrays**
2. **M2: Binary Search**
3. **M3: Recursion and Backtracking**
4. **M4: Dynamic Programming**
5. **M5: Sorting**
6. **M6: Stack and Queue**
7. **M7: LinkedList**
8. **M8: Trees**
9. **M9: HashMap**
10. **M10: Heap**
11. **M11: Graphs**

Each module includes various topics and problem-solving exercises, followed by a challenge.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by modules, corresponding to the course structure. Each module directory contains:
- Java solutions to problems presented in the course
- Solutions to challenge problems
- Any additional notes or explanations for complex problems

## Code Sources

The code in this repository comes from two sources:

1. **Course Examples**: These are solutions typed as taught in the course videos. They are available in the course material and recreated here for practice and reference.

2. **Challenge Answers**: These are my own solutions to the challenge problems presented at the end of each module. These solutions are entirely my own work.

Each file in the repository is clearly marked to indicate whether it's a course example or a challenge solution.

## LeetCode Integration and Execution

- All problems have been solved on LeetCode as well, and the solutions here are structured to match LeetCode's format.
- The code is designed to be easily copy-pasted and run directly.
- Each problem solution includes a test case in the main method, ensuring that the code can be executed and tested immediately.

## Tools Used

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred Java IDE
3. Navigate through the module folders to find specific problem solutions

## Disclaimer

While the challenge solutions are my own work, the course example solutions are based on the instructor's teachings. These solutions may not be the most optimal in all cases. I encourage viewers to use them as a reference for learning rather than as definitive answers.
